# Space Rock Paper Scissors
* [live link] of the project
## Project Overview
In this project I have taken the classic Rock Paper Scissor game and given it a space theme and storyline. The user i.e the solider, must fire a weapon from his spaceship control panel that consists of **Rock**, **Paper** and **Scissors** which must defeat the enemy, the evil space army and bring peace to the galactic kingdom by winning to two wars. The first war consists of 3 battle rounds and after winning those the final war, where the user only has 5 seconds to fire his selected weapon determining the fate of the galaxy.
