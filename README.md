# Space Rock Paper Scissors
* [live link] of the project
## Project Overview
In this project I have taken the classic Rock Paper Scissor game and given it a space theme and storyline. The user i.e the solider, must fire a weapon from his spaceship control panel that consists of **Rock**, **Paper** and **Scissors** which must defeat the enemy, the evil space army and bring peace to the galactic kingdom by winning to two wars. The first war consists of 3 battle rounds and after winning those the final war, where the user only has 5 seconds to fire his selected weapon determining the fate of the galaxy.

## Design
### Layout
 * The layout is a minimalistic and clean, a spaceship cockpit with user and computer display screens and control panel that represents the user weapon selection.

### Typography
![font](docs/font.png)
 * I have used a combination of different styles to convey the theme of space. Using a dark ominous spaceship cockpit background, green highlighted hovering elements i.e display screens and buttons.
 * I also used the font Orbitron very reminesent of the font we have seen and love in the star wars saga.
 * I have also used various galactic solider pngs through out the modals to convey the space storyline.

### Color Scheme
* The primary colors were inspired by the game background. I wanted to  emphasise the green since my first introduction to sci-fi was the the 1979 movie Alien.

### Wireframes
